QIBA - Quantum Inject Backdoor POC

This is a proof-of-concept backdoor which utilizes the NSA quantum inject (QI) technique and IP spoofing.
Please be aware that this is just a POC and not directly usable. The goal of this is to
demonstrate an idea and proof that it works.


The main goal for this backdoor / concept is to still collect valuable information after being kicked out
of a network or after the blue team has restricted access to the host in an imperfect way.

The following list gives an overview of the operations involved:

1 infected_client <--ControlConnection--> whitelisted_host
2 infected_client --leak seq/ack of ControlConnection via whitelisted_host --> ExfilHost
3 ExfilHost --QuantumInject command into ControlConnection--> infected_client
4 infected_client --leak command results via whitelisted_host-->Exfilhost

The above could of course also be implemented with just IP spoofing but as far as I know
that would generate a lot more RST packets and i needed a reason to use QI :p

Pre-requisites
- root or equivalent access on the infected client
- ability to send spoofed packets
- hope the whitelisted_host doesn't IP restrict it's own traffic
- hope the whitelisted_host doesn't port restrict it's own traffic
